## Abstract

The rapid advancement of Deepfake technology, particularly influenced by the intervention of large language models and 3D generation technology, is raising significant concerns across various sectors due to its potential misuse in creating deceptive audio-visual content. The potential misuse of Deepfakes for creating deceptive content has prompted an urgent need for effective detection methodologies. Our tutorial, "Multimedia Deepfake Detection," aims to address this challenge by convening experts from different but related research communities focusing on current challenges brought by Deepfake. The primary objective is to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, exchanging insights and methodologies to enhance the effectiveness of audio-visual Deepfake detection techniques.
